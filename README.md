# Simpler Certiﬁed Radius Maximization by Propagating Covariances
This is the official GitHub repo for the paper: [Simpler Certiﬁed Radius Maximization by Propagating Covariances, CVPR 2021 (oral)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05888)

# Video Introduction
During submission, we create an intuitive [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1ya2oNf5iE), and we put it on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt5acq2GhBpnXb875hiPQYQ).
